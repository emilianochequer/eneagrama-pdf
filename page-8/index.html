        <h1 class="text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
        <p class="love-must-be-the">
          Love must be the most unbalancing experience we all go through. The
          Reformer knows that better than anyone. Not because it actually
          disbalances them, but because Enneagram Ones are aware of the risk and
          keep a sharp eye on their significant other’s values too. <br />
          <br />
          It’s important to share principles and perspectives since they are the
          ground, the solid base upon which you can build anything. So when it
          comes to love, Type Ones are very concerned about the other’s ideals,
          and they have their red flags very clearly established. <br />
          <br />
          The problem is when they try to adjust that other person to their
          ideals, which can bring disagreements and disappointments. Here is
          where Enneagram 1s learn to be more flexible, and open-minded towards
          other ways of life while still living theirs. <br />
          <br />
          Sometimes it is good to only gaze at people for a while to discover
          the beauty and ideals they conjugate.
