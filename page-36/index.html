            <p class="enneagram-type">
              Enneagram Type 1 like you, are dedicated and principled employees
              who value order and structure in their work environments. They
              have a strong sense of personal responsibility and strive to live
              up to their high moral standards.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the workplace, Enneagram 1s may excel in roles that require
              attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving
              abilities. They are often highly organized and focused, and can be
              counted on to meet deadlines and produce high-quality work.
              <br />
              <br />
              At the same time, Enneagram 1s may struggle with perfectionism and
              a tendency towards black-and-white thinking. They may have
              difficulty accepting criticism or feedback and may be highly
              critical of themselves and others.
              <br />
              <br />
              Enneagram 1s may also struggle with flexibility and adaptability
              in the face of change. They may have a strong attachment to
              established routines and processes and may be resistant to new
              ideas or approaches.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the workplace, Enneagram 1s may thrive in environments that
              value integrity, accountability, and attention to detail. They may
              struggle in situations where there is ambiguity or a lack of clear
              guidelines.
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, Enneagram 1s are highly principled and dedicated
              employees who value structure and order in their work
              environments. They may struggle with perfectionism and a
              reluctance to adapt to change, but with support and encouragement,
              they can be highly effective and productive members of a team.
