    However, they do so very differently. Enneagram Type 9 seems to move away
    from instinct, while Enneagram Type 8 and Enneagram Type 1 respectively over
    and under express what their instinct says to them. <br /><br />As they lose
    control, the three members of this Enneagram Triad have to deal with anger
    either by letting it out or repressing it. It’s their gut they trust to
    determine whether the surroundings are safe or even fair, and any lack of
    balance can make these Enneatypes very uncomfortable. That’s when their
    defense mechanisms kick in.
