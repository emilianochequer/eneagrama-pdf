                perfectionist, hard-working people. Taking care of
                responsibilities and keeping up with schedules will tend to come
                first, while pleasure, partying, vacation and leisure will
                definitely come second.<br /><br />In private or personal
                relationships with each other and also with family and friends,
                both will seek to be objective, reasonable, fair, and truthful
                above everything else. They will be able to create a clear and
                precise atmosphere in which their own interactions with each
                connection they establish will feel clean (not sticky or loaded
                with unspoken ulterior motives).<br /><br />This type of pairing
                is often created and maintained by shared ideals and solid
                convictions which they enforce with tolerance and passion.
                Fairness, truthfulness, consistency, respect, and dignity are
                some of the best characteristics that this type of Enneagram
                relationship has. They both have a strong will to put these
                ideals into practice which makes them respect and admire each
                other.<br /><br
